            <h2>Eamonn Kennedy - Horn Player</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Eamonn Kennedy. I have been playing the French horn for the past 8 years. I picked up
                the horn when I was in 7th grade.
                For a career, I wish to play the French Horn. If I can’t get a job related to the horn, I will look for
                something else in the field of music.
                When I first started the horn, I joined the Ottawa Youth Orchestra Academy and have made my way up all
                the way to The Ottawa Youth Orchestra.
                Most recently, I have played with the Ottawa Pops Orchestra. Over the years, I have had two major
                teachers. These include Elizabeth Simpson and Debra Laroque, and more.
                I am now currently studying with Elizabeth Simpson over Skype. Once this pandemic is over, I hope to get
                back to ensemble playing.

                <h2>My Mission</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                My life’s mission is to hopefully become a professional horn player. If possible, I hope to one day play
                the French horn in a professional orchestra. To achieve this,
                I practice the horn every single day. I also get bi-weekly Skype lessons from my teacher, Elizabeth
                Simpson. I have experience playing many different genres of music from Baroque to classical,
                and also pops music like Star Wars and Harry Potter soundtracks. I am constantly learning new things. I
                hope one day to put all my skills to the test and to become a professional.

                <h2>My Vision</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the future, I see myself as a professional French Horn player. I see myself playing with various
                professional orchestras.
                Including hopefully, the National Arts Centre Orchestra here in Ottawa. Playing the French horn has
                always been a lifelong
                ambition of mine. I am determined to do what ever it takes to successfully meet my goals. I will do my
                very best to achieve
                them using which ever methods I happen to use.
