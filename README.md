# MTM6200 Final Project Reflection - Eamonn Kennedy

### Tuesday, August 17th, 2021. 

### During development, I faced many challenges. These included setting up the desktop layout using grid. I had fixed this issue by learning more about grid and experimenting. At first, I had little luck. After hours of practice, I think I was able to get at least some of the grid layout for my desktop correct. 

### By creating my web portfolio, I learned many things. These things included more knownledge on CSS grid. CSS grid has always been hard for me. I just never really fully how it worked. After I finished working on this final, I now believe that I understand grid a resonable amount better. Although my usage of grid is still not perfect. I think I am really starting to get the hang of it. I can now start to see grid layouts starting to take shape. Where as before, they just looked like a jumbled mess. I also learned that putting elements inside div tags and adding a class to them helps with aligning and moving certain objects. Without div tags, I would not be able to move or align these elements.
