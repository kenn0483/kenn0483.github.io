            <p>
                Hello, <em>my name is Eamonn Kennedy.</em> I am 20 years old. This is my second year at Algonquin
                College, last year I was in the <abbr title="Internet Applications and Web Development">IAWD</abbr>
                program. I
                switched to the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program which I started January
                12<sup>th</sup>
                2021. I have experience using Final Cut Pro and Adobe Illustrator. One thing I learned in the Internet
                Applications and Web Development program was how to query a database.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy playing the french horn and I have played in several orchestras in Ottawa.
                I have played the french horn for around 8 years. My other hobbies include such things as
                mountain biking in the Greenbelt and Gatineau Park, and stargazing, although I wish Ottawa
                had less light pollution so I could see more stars.
